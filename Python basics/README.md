- Booleans (True/False) - for conditional logic
- Lists - for multiple prompts or responses
- Dictionaries - for API configurations

**Gen AI Application:**
Understand the data types used in AI API calls and responses. Every API parameter (temperature, max_tokens, etc.) has a specific data type.

**Time:** 30 minutes

**Key Concepts:**
- `temperature = 0.7` ← Float for creativity control
- `max_tokens = 1000` ← Integer for response length
- `model_config = {"model": "gpt-4"}` ← Dictionary for settings

---

#### Lesson 3: String Manipulation (`03_strings_manipulation.py`)
**What you'll learn:**
- String operations (length, upper, lower)
- Concatenating strings
- String formatting
- String methods (strip, replace, split)
- Checking string content

**Gen AI Application:**
Essential for processing user prompts, cleaning input, and formatting AI responses. String manipulation is 50% of working with AI!

**Time:** 30 minutes

**Real Example:**
```python
user_prompt = "  generate python code  "
clean_prompt = user_prompt.strip().lower()
# Now you can check if "python" is in the prompt
```

---

- While loops (repeat until condition)
- List comprehensions
- Processing multiple items

**Gen AI Application:**
Process multiple prompts, handle conversation history, batch process AI responses, and manage chat messages.

**Time:** 45 minutes

**Real Example:**
```python
conversation = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hello"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi there!"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "How are you?"}
]

**Time:** 45 minutes

**Critical Concept:**
```python
# This is how you send data to an AI API
api_request = {
    "model": "gpt-4",
    "messages": [
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}
    ],
    "temperature": 0.7,

    """Reusable function to call AI with custom settings"""
    # Your API call code here
    return response
```

---

#### Lesson 7: Conditionals (`07_conditionals.py`)
**What you'll learn:**
- If statements
- If-else statements
- If-elif-else chains
- Multiple conditions (and/or)

**Gen AI Application:**
Make decisions in your AI code: validate inputs, check response quality, handle different model types, and implement logic based on user choices.

**Time:** 45 minutes

**Real Example:**
```python
if "image" in prompt.lower():
    use_model = "dall-e-3"
elif "code" in prompt.lower():
    use_model = "gpt-4"
else:
    use_model = "gpt-3.5-turbo"
```

---

### **Phase 3: File Handling & Error Management** 🟠 (Intermediate-Advanced)

#### Lesson 8: File Operations (`08_file_operations.py`)
**What you'll learn:**

**Time:** 1 hour

**Critical for Production:**
```python
try:
    response = call_ai_api(prompt)
except ConnectionError:
    print("Network error - retrying...")
except AuthenticationError:
    print("Invalid API key")
except RateLimitError:
    print("Too many requests - wait and retry")
```

---

## 💡 Tips for Success

### 1. **Code Every Day**
Even 15-30 minutes daily is better than 3 hours once a week. Consistency builds muscle memory.

### 2. **Type, Don't Copy-Paste**
Typing code helps you remember syntax and understand structure.

### 3. **Read Error Messages**
They're your friends! They tell you exactly what went wrong and often how to fix it.

### 4. **Experiment Freely**
Change values, break things, fix them. That's how you truly learn.

### 5. **Use Print Statements**
When confused, print variables to see their values. It's the simplest debugging technique.

### 6. **Google Is Your Friend**
"Python how to..." followed by your question usually gives great results.

### 7. **Ask for Help**
Stuck for more than 30 minutes? Ask on forums, Discord, or Stack Overflow.

### 8. **Build Projects**
Apply what you learn immediately in small projects. Knowledge without application fades.

### 9. **Don't Rush**
It's okay if a lesson takes longer than estimated. Understanding > Speed.

### 10. **Have Fun!**
Programming should be enjoyable. If you're frustrated, take a break and come back refreshed.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: "Python is not recognized"
**Solution:** Add Python to PATH during installation, or reinstall Python with "Add to PATH" checked.

### Issue: "No module named..."
**Solution:** You need to install packages. We'll cover this in advanced lessons.

### Issue: "IndentationError"
**Solution:** Python uses indentation (spaces/tabs) to define code blocks. Make sure indentation is consistent.

### Issue: "SyntaxError"
**Solution:** Check for missing quotes, parentheses, or colons. Read the error message carefully.

### Issue: Code runs but no output
**Solution:** Make sure you have `print()` statements to display results.
